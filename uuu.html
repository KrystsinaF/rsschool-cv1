<h1>What should a Junior Developer Resume contain?</h1>;

<body> Important: write your Resume in English if you can, if possible

<ul>1. First Name, Last Name (real ones)</ul>
<ul>2. Contact Info (add several ways to contact you)</ul>
<ul>3. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).</ul>
<ul>4. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)</ul>
<ul>5. Code examples (LATEST)</ul>
<ul>6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)</ul>
<ul>7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)</ul>
<ul>8. English (elaborate on what kind of practice you had, if any, how long it lasted and so on)</ul>
</body>
